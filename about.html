            <p>I'm a huge fan of animation, and has practiced quite a bit of it myself. I practice some animation for fun. Drawing and practicing animation is one of my favorite hobby, and passion of mine.</p>
            <p>I practice 2D animation for the most part. I have been using Moho (formerly Anime Studio) for both frame-by-frame and vector animation; vector animation is essentially the same thing as Flash. The way that animation company advertise their programs seem like really fun, but tend to have my own way, and make things work my way. I have never used any other program, but would love to use other programs.</p>
            <p>If there is anything you saw that you liked, please feel free to contact me about my animations, or if there are any questions. My contact information is located below the page.</p>
